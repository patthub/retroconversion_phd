# Bibliographic record type Classification with CNN

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for bibliographic record classification purposes. It uses PyTorch for model training and evaluation, with data preprocessing steps involving pandas, scikit-learn, and Keras.

## Installation

To set up your environment to run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash

git clone https://yourprojectrepository.git
cd yourprojectdirectory
```


2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional, but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
```


3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

To train the model with your data, ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with the required columns (`Rekord` for text and `Etykiety` for labels)
